Common house
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Looking around
--------------

[LOCATION]_

    You stand before a large circular structure. It is built of
    wood and thatch. This is a common house for shelter and storage.

[LOCATION]_

    The ground about is deeply rutted. Straw binds the pathway past
    the Common House.
