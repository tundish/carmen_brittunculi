Waking
------

[NARRATOR]_

    The creaking never wakes me.

    It's when the door slaps shut, I wake.

    In my sleep I dream the creaking. And the
    knocking of blocks as they drop in a basket.

[NARRATOR]_

    Which logs has she taken today?

    From the top of the pile along from the door.

    That is the dry wood.
