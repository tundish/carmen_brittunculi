Armoury
~~~~~~~

Looking around
--------------

[LOCATION]_

    High up on the walls are fixed several shields. They are
    a mixed collection from various Roman regiments. Some are
    damaged; others look almost new.

[LOCATION]_

    The only weapon within reach is what might be a Gladius.
    It hangs in its scabbard from an iron ring near the door.
