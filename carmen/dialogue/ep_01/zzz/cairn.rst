Cairn
~~~~~

Looking around
--------------

[LOCATION]_

    The path widens. Directly before you is a tall, neat pile
    of stones.

[LOCATION]_

    The structure is compact and stable. The rocks have been
    carefully placed to fit closely together.

    Here and there are strands of coloured rags. The Cairn receives
    regular attention.
