Waking
------

[NARRATOR]_

    The creaking does not wake me.

    When the door slaps shut, then I wake.

    In my sleep I heard a creaking. And the
    knocking of the blocks as they dropped in a basket.

[NARRATOR]_

    Which logs does she take today?

    From the top of the pile along from the door.

    That is my dry wood.
