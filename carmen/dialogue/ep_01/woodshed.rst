Waking
------

[NARRATOR]_

    The creaking does not wake me.

    When the door slaps shut, then I wake.

    Slowly I recall I'd been listening to the creaking for some time. And the
    knocking of the blocks as they drop into the basket.

[NARRATOR]_

    Which logs did she choose?

    From the top of the pile along from the door.

    That is the dry wood.
