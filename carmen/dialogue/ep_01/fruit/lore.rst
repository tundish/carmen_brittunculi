What we know
------------

[NARRATOR]_

    You must not eat a Cubby Apple. If it's on the tree you let it fall.

[NARRATOR]_

    And having fallen, you let it sit.

    The small animals will not touch it. They know the flesh is bitter.

[NARRATOR]_

    Chance a pig will snuffle it and crush it, but they mostly leave them be.
