Cadi talks of Cubby Apples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good news
---------

[CADI]_

    I keep telling Bryn how well you know the Wood.

[NARRATOR]_

    She splits the apples. Around the grate are the stones, roasting.
    The bronze pot bubbles with the apple stew.

    She takes a board and stamps the mash.

[CADI]_

    The flesh is for the goats. They will have it when it is cooked.

[NARRATOR]_

    She grins at me. She is going to tell me her secret.

[CADI]_

    It is the skin that makes the Ale brew.
    I put the peelings in with the grain. And water from the stream.

[NARRATOR]_

    She stops stirring and looks at me.

[CADI]_

    Soon we'll be making Ale together, you and me!
