Cadi talks of Cubby Apples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good news
---------

[CADI]_

    I have told to Bryn how well you know the Wood.

[NARRATOR]_

    She has split the apples. Around the grate are the stones, roasting.
    The rest is in the bronze.

    She takes a board and stamps the mash.

[CADI]_

    The flesh is for the goats. They will have it when it is cooked.

[NARRATOR]_

    She grins. She is going to tell me her secret.

[CADI]_

    It is the skin which makes the Ale brew.
    I put the peelings in with the grain. And water from the stream.

[NARRATOR]_

    She stops stirring and looks at me.

[CADI]_

    Soon we'll make Ale together!
