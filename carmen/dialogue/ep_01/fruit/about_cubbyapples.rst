Cadi talks of Cubby Apples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good news
---------

[CADI]_

    I have told to |BRYN| how well you know the Wood.

[NARRATOR]_

    She has split the apples.

    Around the grate are the inner stones, roasting.

    The rest is in the bronze.

[CADI]_

    These apples are forever unbitten.

    You know well not to eat them, |PLAYER|!

[NARRATOR]_

    She takes a board and stamps the mash.

[CADI]_

    The flesh is for the goats. They will have it when it is cooked.

[NARRATOR]_

    She grins. She is going to tell me her secret.

[CADI]_

    It is the skin which makes the Ale brew.

    I put the peelings in with the grain. And water from the stream.

[NARRATOR]_

    She stops stirring and looks at me.

[CADI]_

    From the stream. Never take the water of the pool.

    Soon we'll make the Ale together!
