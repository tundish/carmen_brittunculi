<h1>About this project</h1>
<p class="speech">Carmen Brittunculi is an interactive adventure story.</p>
<h2 class="persona" style="padding-top: 1em;">History</h2>
<p class="speech">I started it in 2018 for the
<a href="https://itch.io/jam/roman-mytholojam">Roman Mytholojam</a>.
It wasn't really playable until a year later after more work during the
<a href="https://itch.io/jam/world-mytholojam">2019 jam</a>.
</p>
<p class="speech">Currently only the first part exists of what will be a multi-episode piece, so
it remains a work-in-progress.</p>
<h2 class="persona" style="padding-top: 1em;">Technology</h2>
<p class="speech">Carmen is Free Software; a technical demo of what I call a <em>Web Native</em> game.</p>
<p class="speech">It uses only Python, SVG, HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
<p class="speech">It is structured and packaged to production standards.</p>
<p class="speech">It has been designed for deployment on modern container-based Cloud platforms.</p>
<p class="speech">You should also be able to run it locally on any recent Operating System.</p>
<p class="speech">It has very modest hardware requirements.</p>
<h2 class="persona" style="padding-top: 1em;">Workflow</h2>
<p class="speech">All code and styling was done by hand using only a <a href="https://www.vim.org/"> simple text editor</a>.</p>
<p class="speech">There's no actual art at the moment. The scenery is procedurally generated.</p>
<p class="speech">The audio on the other hand is real. All music was performed and recorded entirely using real
instruments and effects devices. The only time I used any software was to trim the cues to length.
<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> did the job there.</p>
